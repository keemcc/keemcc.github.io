        <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

        <div class="reflection"><span id="firstLetter">R</span>eflecting on my journey in the field of Computer Science, I am proud of the
            progress I have made and the skills I have acquired. From my early days of coding simple
            programs to developing complex applications, each step has been a learning experience.
            My internships and volunteer work have not only honed my technical abilities but also
            taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and continuous
            improvement. I have learned to approach problems methodically, break them down into
            manageable parts, and persist until I find a solution. <br>
            <p>My career goals are driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to make a
            meaningful impact through technology. I aim to become a software engineer at a leading
            tech company, where I can work on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible. I
            am particularly interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
            cybersecurity, as I believe these fields hold the key to solving some of the most pressing
            challenges of our time. My goal is to contribute to the development of technologies that
            improve people's lives and drive societal progress. </p>

            development. The tech industry is constantly evolving, and I understand the importance of
            staying updated with the latest advancements and trends. I plan to pursue further
            education and certifications to deepen my knowledge and enhance my skill set.
            Additionally, I aspire to take on leadership roles where I can mentor others, share my
            experiences, and help shape the next generation of tech professionals. </p>
            <p>In summary, my journey in Computer Science has been a rewarding and
            transformative experience. It has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to pursue a
            fulfilling career in technology. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am
            determined to make a positive impact in the industry. By staying true to my values of
            perseverance, adaptability, and continuous learning, I am confident that I can achieve my
            career goals and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.</p></div>
