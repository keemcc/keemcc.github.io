            <p>Hello, my name is Keehin McCann. I am a sophomore Computer Science
            student at Mizzou. I excel with A's in my courses and have earned a spot on the High
            Dean's List. My passion for computing includes both software and hardware. I have
            engaged in undergraduate research to learn more about semiconductors. One of my
            hobbies is 3D printing. This has allowed me to learn new types of software and feed my
            creativity by making unique designs. I also have an interest in video games. I have spent
            some time developing my skills in Unity. I have learned coding languages such as Python,
            C, and C#. Python and C are my strongest languages. My professional goal is to pursue a
            career in software development. I want to apply my skills to create innovative solutions. I
            am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. I look forward to
            collaborating with others to push the boundaries of technology. I want to make a
            meaningful impact in the tech community.</p>
